A transponder is an invisible block which the AEL's "Radio" part will hit to complete something to do with the displays.

Each transponder has it's own script embedded in the part.

Each transponder has a value titled "DisplayValue" embedded in the part.

The Displays' "Radio" part will hit this block and read what value is on "DisplayValue".

The value in the part must be one of the codes within "Codes.lua".
